# Stats845-Project
This folder consist of following:

1. 4 Indiviual .py files covering different cases of Neural Network 
2. 1 .ipynb files(SVM_RF.ipynb) that contains Data Analysis, SVM and Random Forest Code
3. 1 .ipynb files(PCA_CNN) containing code for data batching, PCA and convolutional neural network.
 
While .py needs python on your system to be executed, the .ipynb file needs jupyter (https://jupyter.org/).
The data used in these code can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000 .

*All the work was done using python, with major usage of numpy, pandas, tensorflow and scikit-learn packages.
